#### Key Research Findings: The Science of Effective Flirting

**1. Detection and Subtlety Issues**
- Only 28% of flirting attempts are accurately detected by recipients
- Women are particularly poor at detecting male flirting (18% accuracy)
- Flirters are often too subtle to protect self-esteem and avoid rejection
- **Implication for AI**: Suggestions should be more direct and obvious

**2. Most Effective Universal Tactics**
- **Top Strategy**: Expressing that the other person is funny (laughing at jokes, giggling)
- This works for both men and women across cultures (US and Norway study)

**3. Gender-Specific Effective Strategies**

**For Women:**
- Physical contact (but not hugs - too friendly)
- Avoid humor (can signal friendship rather than romantic interest)
- Specific facial expression: head tilted slightly down and to side, eyes forward, slight smile
- 77% of men perceived this expression as flirtatious

**For Men:**
- Focus on good conversations
- Give genuine compliments
- Use humor effectively
- Avoid being too subtle

**4. Body Language and Positioning**
- Expansive body posture increases attractiveness for both genders
- Take up more physical space (wider stance, arms open)
- Signals confidence and social status
- Avoid crossed arms or closed postures

**5. Context and Timing Considerations**
- Different flirting styles work better at different times
- Playful flirting is best for short-term relationships
- More sincere approaches work better for long-term intentions

#### Implications for AI System Design

**1. Directness Over Subtlety**
- AI should suggest more obvious flirting approaches
- Avoid overly subtle suggestions that may go undetected

**2. Gender-Aware Recommendations**
- Tailor suggestions based on user's gender and target's gender
- Different strategies for men vs women

**3. Context Analysis**
- Analyze photos for body language and positioning cues
- Suggest responses that acknowledge confident vs shy body language

**4. Humor Integration**
- Prioritize suggestions that acknowledge or build on humor
- For men: suggest humorous responses
- For women: suggest appreciating the other person's humor


### Multimodal Prompt Engineering Best Practices

#### Core Principles from Google Cloud Research

**1. Use Specific Instructions**
- Clear and detailed prompts provide the best results
- Include specific output requirements in the prompt
- Avoid underspecified prompts that could be interpreted multiple ways
- **Dating Application**: Instead of "describe this profile," use "analyze this dating profile for personality traits, interests, and conversation starters"

**2. Add Examples (Few-Shot Learning)**
- Provide multiple input-output examples to establish patterns
- Help the model understand the desired response format
- **Dating Application**: Show examples of good flirting suggestions for different profile types

**3. Split Complex Tasks into Smaller Tasks**
- Break down complex analysis into step-by-step processes
- Ask the model to "think step by step"
- **Dating Application**: 
  - Step 1: Analyze visual elements (clothing, setting, activities)
  - Step 2: Identify personality indicators
  - Step 3: Generate contextual conversation starters

**4. Specify Output Format**
- Define exact format requirements (JSON, lists, structured responses)
- **Dating Application**: Request structured output with confidence scores, suggestion categories, and reasoning

**5. Focus on Relevant Parts**
- Direct attention to specific areas of images
- Point out which elements are most important for analysis
- **Dating Application**: "Focus on the background activities and clothing style to suggest conversation topics"

#### Advanced Techniques for Dating Context

**1. Context-Aware Analysis**
- Analyze multiple elements: facial expressions, body language, setting, activities
- Consider cultural and social context clues
- Identify conversation opportunities from visual elements

**2. Layered Prompt Structure**
```
System Role: You are an expert dating coach and social psychology analyst
Task: Analyze dating app screenshots for flirting suggestions
Context: [User gender], [Target gender], [App type]
Instructions: [Specific analysis steps]
Output Format: [Structured response format]
Examples: [Few-shot examples]
```

**3. Multi-Step Reasoning Chain**
- Visual Analysis → Personality Assessment → Interest Identification → Suggestion Generation
- Each step builds on the previous analysis
- Maintain consistency across the reasoning chain

**4. Error Prevention Strategies**
- Include safeguards against inappropriate suggestions
- Verify suggestions are contextually appropriate
- Consider age, cultural, and social appropriateness

#### Implementation Framework for Flirrt.ai

**Prompt Template Structure:**
1. **Role Definition**: Expert dating coach with psychology background
2. **Context Setting**: Dating app environment, user demographics
3. **Task Specification**: Analyze profile for flirting opportunities
4. **Analysis Steps**: Visual → Personality → Interests → Suggestions
5. **Output Format**: Structured JSON with confidence scores
6. **Quality Controls**: Appropriateness checks and reasoning explanations
