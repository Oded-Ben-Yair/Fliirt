# Flirrt.ai Development Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the systematic development approach for Flirrt.ai, leveraging multiple AI models for optimal results and following Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles.

## AI Model Utilization Strategy

### GPT-5 (OpenAI)
- **Primary Use**: Visual analysis, code review, technical documentation
- **Strengths**: Superior multimodal understanding, technical accuracy
- **Applications**: Screenshot analysis, architecture planning, code quality assurance

### Grok 4 (xAI)
- **Primary Use**: UX/UI design, flirting suggestion generation, personality-driven features
- **Strengths**: Human-like interaction, bold suggestions, cultural awareness
- **Applications**: Flirting content generation, user experience design, creative features

### Gemini 2.5 Pro (Google)
- **Primary Use**: Performance optimization, testing strategies, large-scale analysis
- **Strengths**: Speed, large context window, efficiency
- **Applications**: Performance testing, batch processing, fallback AI service

### GPT-4o (OpenAI)
- **Primary Use**: Visual analysis implementation, multimodal processing
- **Strengths**: Proven visual understanding, reliable API
- **Applications**: Real-time screenshot analysis, image processing pipeline
